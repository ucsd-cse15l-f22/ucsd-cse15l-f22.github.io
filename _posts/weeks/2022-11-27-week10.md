## Skill Demo 2 Tasks

Where this says “locally”, it means either on your own computer or on one of the lab computers. Where this says “ieng6” or “on the server”, it means logged into your course-specific account on ieng6.

In the video, narrate by announcing each step by number when you’ve completed it – for example “here’s the page loaded in the browser, that’s the completion of step 4”, and so on. All the tasks should be completed in a single video take. It’s OK if the video includes mistakes and retries at specific task, as long as everything is under 15 minutes.

1. Make a fork of this sample student repository: https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-signature
2. Clone this version of the autograder repository on ieng6: https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-grader-skill-demo2/
3. Build and start the server on ieng6.
4. Show the result of running your fork of the sample student repository on the autograder in a browser or using curl. You must use the https://ieng6-20X... URL to load it. (It should show a compilation error because of incompatible types, and then output about failing to run JUnit and a misleading score.)
5. Change the autograder script so that instead of continuing after the compilation error, it instead prints a message that says “Failed to compile, 0/4”, and stops early. (We recommend, but don’t require, that you use vim for this step.)
6. Show the result of running your fork of the sample student repository on the updated autograder.
7. Fix your fork of the updated student repository so that it no longer has a compile error. Commit and push it to Github.
8. Show the result of running your (fixed) fork of the sample student repository on the updated autograder (it should get a full score).

### Submission
Upload your video to the “Skill Demonstration 2” assignment on Gradescope. This is due by 10pm on Monday, December 5 (there is a short grace period built into the Gradescope assignment until 11:59pm).
