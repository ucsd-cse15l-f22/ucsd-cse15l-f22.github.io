## Lab Tasks

This week's lab task is _optional_. If you skip it, there's no penalty to your
grade; it is an opportunity to make up previous missed participation credit. We
reduced the total number of required lab participation by 1 to accommodate
this.

The purpose of this lab is twofold:

1. Get you acquainted with making video screencast recordings in preparation
for Skill Demonstration 2.
2. Give you an opportunity to demonstrate understanding of a past lab
assignment.

Choose a past lab assignment for which you didn't get participation credit.
Record a short (less than 5-minute) video of you demonstrating the main
outcomes of that lab. If you have participation credit for all past labs, you
may still benefit from the practice – choose any one of them to make the video
for.

There's a tutorial for generating screencasts like this at the bottom of this
page:

[https://ucsd-cse11-f21.github.io/assignments/pa2.html](https://ucsd-cse11-f21.github.io/assignments/pa2.html)

As long as your video demonstrates understanding of the main tasks of that lab,
you can earn back the missed participation credit for a past lab. Don't worry
about making the video polished and perfect; the goal is to demonstrate
understanding of that material and make sure you know how to create a video
like this.

This participation activity is due before class on Wednesday, December 1
(noon).  You can submit the video via the Gradescope assignment “Lab 9
Participation”.
